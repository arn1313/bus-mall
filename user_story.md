Bus Mall User Stories

The Marketing Team
As the MT, i want to see what images interest the user and which photos they are most likely to touch.
I want a record of which images are picked and how often they are picked when presented.


The Developer
As a dev i want to create a way to present 3 photos at a time and provide a way for the user to interact with the images.
I want to make sure that every time the photos reset the user is provided with 3 images that were not in the last group of images, but they can be used in the next slideshow.
I want to create a way to tally all of the users choices. I need the function to run 25 times and then have a button appear to view the results.
I also need to create a pleasant user interface through html and css.


Focus Group Participants
I would like to be entertained while taking the survey.
I would like an easy to navigate and pleasant to look at interface.
